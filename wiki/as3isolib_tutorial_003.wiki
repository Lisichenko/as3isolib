#summary Styling an IIsoPrimitive class

= tutorial =

The as3isolib IIsoPrimitive primitive types have various styling attributes available for customization.

Those attributes are:
  * render style - determines if the primitive is rendered as a shaded, solid or wireframe model.
  * face line alphas - polygon edge alphas.
  * face line colors - polygon edge colors
  * face line thicknesses - polygon edge thicknesses
  * face alphas - polygon fill alphas
  * face colors - polygon fill colors

By default all IIsoPrimitives are rendered as RenderStyleType.SHADED meaning that individual faces are shaded to different colors to add to the perception of depth.  RenderStyleType.SOLID will draw all faces with color #FFFFFF.  RenderStyleType.WIREFRAME renders all faces as transparent.  Rendered as transparent allows mouse events to still be triggered.
