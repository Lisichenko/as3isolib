I am putting out a challenge to you artistic folks. The challenge: design a simple logo for the as3isolib library (http://code.google.com/p/as3isolib/)

After receiving an adequate number of submissions, I will post the top 10 selections on the as3isolib users' group (http://groups.google.com/group/as3isolib-users-group) and put it to a vote.

Obviously if yours is selected, you will get the honor of having your logo represent the coolest as3 isometric library out there. There are no rules, just a few suggestions:

  * simple
  * possible incorporate isometric content
  * not too many colors
  * simple sans-serif fonts (where applicable)

Some basic info:

  * base/demographic is basically game designers/developers
  * logo will be displayed both on the project home (google code) as well as the users group, print is not a targeted medium at this point but might be at some point in the future
  * winning logo will most definitely have some sort of link back to their portfolio at the very least
  * the deadline for this will be Dec 31, 2008 @ 11:59PM EST


Anyway, I look forward to your submissions. Please submit them to the following email address: as3isolib {at} gmail {dot} com
